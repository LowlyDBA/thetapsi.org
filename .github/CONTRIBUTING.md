# Contributing

## All Contributors Bot

You can use [all contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) to attribute work to folks who may not be making actual commits/PRs (admin work, design, copy, etc.)

> Comment on Issue or Pull Request, asking @all-contributors to add a contributor:
>
> @all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>
> <contribution>: See the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid contribution types.
> 
> The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor, then reply with the pull request details.
